	    <h2> Using the Mammouth Ms2 and Mp2 super computer: steps to follow </h2>
	    
        <p>
          To get a working account on Sherbrooke's <a href="https://rqchp.ca/?pageId=1388">Mammouth Ms2 or Mp2</a> super computers, you must go through the
          following steps:
        </p>

	    <ul>
          <li> Create account on Compute Canada platform by completing
            the online
            form: <a href="https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/account_application">https://ccdb.computecanada.ca/account_application</a>.<br>
            When asked for the Compute Canada Role Identifier of your
            sponsor, enter <b>ycy-622-03</b>.<br><br>

          <li> I will then be able to grant you access to the Mammouth Ms2 and/or Mp2 super
          computer. This step can require two or three days, after which you
          will receive an email confirming your access to the super
          computer. The email will also specify how you can 
          connect to the super computer using
          the <tt><a href="http://support.suso.com/supki/SSH_Tutorial_for_Linux">ssh</a></tt>
          linux program. The command line to use should look something like this:
            <br><br>
            <pre>
ssh USERNAME@larochel-ms.ccs.usherbrooke.ca # for Ms2
ssh USERNAME@larochel-mp2.ccs.usherbrooke.ca # for Mp2
            </pre>
            where <tt>USERNAME</tt> is the assigned to you for your account. This will allow you to connect
            to an interactive node, on which you can install software for your account and debug your
            code. However, never run long experiments on the interactive node: you need to use
            <tt>jobdispatch</tt> to launch such experiments on the compute nodes of the super computer (see below).
            <br><br>
          <li> The first time you connect to the interative node, you'll need to modify your <tt>~/.bashrc</tt> file by adding the following lines in it
            (you can use the <tt><a href="http://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/tcl-course/emacs-tutorial.html">emacs</a></tt> program to edit the file):
            <br><br>
            <pre>
# User specific aliases and functions
alias rm='rm -i'
alias cp='cp -i'
alias mv='mv -i'

# To look at the ms queue
export BQMAMMOUTH=ms
#export BQMAMMOUTH=mp2 # use this line instead if on Mp2

# Add Python
#module add python64/2.6.4
module add python64/2.7.1
export CPATH=$CPATH:/opt/python64/2.7.1/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include

# Add boost
module add boost64/1.38.0

# Add lapack
module add lapack64
module add mkl64/10.1.3.027

# For job launching
PATH=$PATH:/home/laroche1/software/Jobman/bin
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/home/laroche1/software/Jobman
</pre>
<br>
          <li>
            You'll also need to install MLPython in your account, like
            you would on your own computer. Simply follow
            the <a href="http://www.dmi.usherb.ca/~larocheh/mlpython/install.html#install">installation instructions</a>, except those
            regarding the installation of other librairies required by
            MLPython (they should already be installed).
            <br><br>
            <li> Say you have a Python script <tt>run_nnet.py</tt> which can be run as follows:
              <br><br>
              <pre>
python run_nnet.py 0.01 0 [20,10] 0 0 1234 True
              </pre>
              You would now like to run the same script but with different values of its arguments.
              To launch such experiments (jobs) on the Mammouth Mp2's compute nodes, you can use the <tt>jobdispatch</tt> program, as follows:
              <br><br>
              <pre>
jobdispatch --bqtools --queue=qwork@mp2 python run_nnet.py '{{0.01,0.001}}' 0 ['{{20,10}}','{{10,40}}'] 0 0 1234 True
              </pre>
              In this example, 8 jobs (2 x 2 x 2 = 8) will be launched, corresponding to all combinations
              of values within each set <tt>'{{A,B,C...}}'</tt>.
              <br><br>
              To launch experiments on Ms2, simply remove the <tt>--queue=qwork@mp2</tt>
              from the command line in the example above.  
              <br><br>
              In a directory named <tt>LOGS</tt> (created the first time you use <tt>jobdispatch</tt>), 
              log files will be added for each job. They will be put in separate subdirectories
              (one for each time you use <tt>jobdispatch</tt>) within <tt>LOGS</tt>.
              Each job will have its own <tt>ID.out</tt> (standard output) and <tt>ID.err</tt> file, where
              <tt>ID</tt> is a number assigned to each job.
              <br><br>
              You can then use the <tt>bqwatch</tt> command to track whether your batch of jobs is
              still running. On Mp2, <tt>bqwatch</tt> automatically groups the jobs in batches of up to 24 jobs,
              so don't be surprised if it displays a smaller number than the total number of jobs.
              <br><br>
              Finally, if you launch jobs, realize after there is a bug in your code and wish to kill them, the command <tt>bqkill</tt>
              will do that for you. Just run <tt>bqkill</tt> and a prompt will ask you to
              specify which batch of jobs you'd like to kill among those you are currently running.
