	  <h1>ECML/PKDD 2014 - Deep Learning Tutorial</h1>
	  <b>Presenters:</b> <a href="http://aaroncourville.wordpress.com/">Aaron Courville</a> and <a href="http://info.usherbrooke.ca/hlarochelle/index_en.html">Hugo Larochelle</a>

	  <p> Deep learning is one of the most rapidly growing areas
	  of machine learning. It concerns the learning of multiple
	  layers of representation that gradually transform the input
	  into a form where a given task can be performed more
	  effectively. Deep learning has recently been responsible for
	  an impressive number of state-of-the-art results in a wide
	  array of domains, including object detection and
	  recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing
	  tasks, bio-informatics and reinforcement learning.</p>
	  
	  <p>In this tutorial we will cover the foundations of deep
	  learning: neural networks, convolutional neural networks,
	  recurrent neural networks, autoencoders and Boltzmann
	  machines. We will discuss why models with many layers of
	  representation can be hard to learn and present strategies
	  that have been developed to overcome these challenges. We
	  will also discuss more recent innovations including dropout
	  training that has proved to be an extremely effective
	  regularization technique for training neural
	  networks. Finally, we will cover some concrete and
	  successful applications of deep learning.</p>
